# 📘 Cracking the Coding Interview – Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from the book **Cracking the Coding Interview (6th Edition)** by *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*.

I’m solving each problem in **C#**, focusing on clean code, problem-solving techniques, and deeply understanding algorithms and data structures — not just memorizing answers.
